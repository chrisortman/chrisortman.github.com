<p>My dad has asked me to build him a small app to help him put together car listings and sync them between cars.com, craigslist and various other sites. I thought a WPF app and a SQL CE database would fit quite nicely for this. I have also been looking for an excuse to play with some of the new <a href="http://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui">ReactiveUI</a> bits so win / win there. His computer is still on XP so it will have to target .NET 4.0</p>

<p>My biggest concern with this tech choice is that I expect he will delegate a lot of the actual management to his better half so I will wind up needing to have the app run on multiple computers which will beg for a shared database of some kind.</p>

<p>I figure that for starters EntityFramework will be the easiest thing to get started with.</p>

<p>You run into some problems here because <code>install-package entityframework</code> wants to pull down EF 5, but EntityFramework.SqlCompact is still depending on EF 4.3.1. Also since I&#8217;m using XUnit for my tests thier test runner wants you to target 4.5 and using EF 4.3 on .NET 4.5 causes some warnings (though I don&#8217;t think they will matter)</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do this enough for desktop apps, and boy for some reason I can&#8217;t seem to remember that static Database class to configure my initializers. I also thought about storing the database file in a user specific folder, but that isn&#8217;t a front and center option and doesn&#8217;t turn up in the top 3 of a google query so it will require a little investigation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>I am doing a bugfix in some older code that uses direct ADO.NET for queries. This code handles some online directory stuff so there are things like SearchPeople, SearchBusiness, SearchGovernment. You can tell from looking at these functions that the first function was written and then the other two were built by copy / paste and change a couple lines.</p>

<p>Something that is difficult when you have large functions that have been built this way is that you can tell they are /very/ similar but without careful examination you don&#8217;t know exactly what is different.</p>

<p>Because to fix this bug I will need to make the same change in 3 different places I know that I should refactor this so that much of the common code is in at the very least a set of helper functions.</p>

<p>To start this excercise I want to build some <a href="http://approvaltests.sourceforge.net/">ApprovalTests</a> first so that I can get my code coverage high and have a better feel for if/when I break some existing behavior.</p>

<p>Once I had the tests in place I could go about the process of factoring out and combining common code. At one point I had extracted some code from each of my 3 search methods and upon rerunning the tests I found something had broken. It was my own fault for changing too much between running the tests, but what I really wished I could do is undo changes until I could find the exact spot where I had broken the tests, but then I would also need to replay those changes, however, relying on edit/redo to do this would be just as likely to break something else. What I really wanted here was <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">git-bisect</a></p>

<h3>Scalability</h3>

<p>I saw this <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/10/15/simpler-cheaper-faster-playtomics-move-from-net-to-node-and.html">blog post</a> about a company moving from ASP.Net to nodejs and Heroku. Now they have <em>massive</em> scale and I can only imagine the type of problems that that could expose, but the issues that they address seem to be addressable in ASP.Net, at least addressable in less work that it would seem to be to move port everything to a new platform.</p>

<ul>
<li>Background Workers - Wouldn&#8217;t ASP.Net cache expiration handle this?</li>
<li>Pooled Redis Connections - I have never used the <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis">Service Stack Redis Client</a> but I have to imagine you could get comparable connection pooling semantics from it (even if it required some modification).</li>
</ul>


<h3>RazorPDF</h3>

<p>I saw the <a href="http://nyveldt.com/blog/post/Introducing-RazorPDF">RazorPDF</a> project get announced today via twitter. Looks really cool and I can imagine a lot of scenarios for it. But what caught my eye even more was <a href="http://razorant.com/apps">some of the neat little applications</a> that the developer <a href="http://nyveldt.com/blog/page/about-al-nyveldt">Al Nyveldt</a> has built in his free time.</p>

<p>I got into software development because I want to build cool things, and I have several ideas for games I would like to build for my kids to play. Mostly these are ideas that come to me while helping them with their homework or answering some of the crazy random questions they ask during the day. The problem is I have too many of these ideas and am not able to produce them as fast as I would like, so when someone is able to accomplish that I greatly admire them. So /hattip to you Mr. Nyveldt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On tap: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Leinenkugels-Summer-Shandy/43479912786">Leinenkugels Summer Shandy</a><br/>
On the tube: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">Star Trek</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1270798/">X-Men: First Class</a></p>

<p>Time for some <a href="http://clojure.org">clojure</a> again. I am getting impatient to finish this book because I want to get cracking on a few projects
and working on <a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr">clojure-clr</a></p>

<p>Grasping some fundamentals. Let&#8217;s talk about reduce.</p>

<p><code>(doc reduce)</code> says:</p>

<blockquote><p>([f coll] [f val coll])<br/>  f should be a function of 2 arguments. If val is not supplied,<br/>  returns the result of applying f to the first 2 items in coll, then<br/>  applying f to that result and the 3rd item, etc. If coll contains no<br/>  items, f must accept no arguments as well, and reduce returns the<br/>  result of calling f with no arguments.  If coll has only 1 item, it<br/>  is returned and f is not called.  If val is supplied, returns the<br/>  result of applying f to val and the first item in coll, then<br/>  applying f to that result and the 2nd item, etc. If coll contains no<br/>  items, returns val and f is not called.</p></blockquote>


<p>So&#8230; <code>(reduce + [1 2])</code> will give us 3 and <code>(reduce + 5 [1 2])</code> will give us 8 because we apply the plus to 5, then to 1 which gives us 6 then to 2 which gives us 8</p>

<p>We can use <code>fn</code> to define an anonymous function, so&#8230;</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(reduce (fn [x y] (+ x y)) [1 2])</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>will be the same as above and give us 3.</p>

<p>I think the thing that worries me most about clojure is that it is awesome, but it requires such a tremendous amout of brain power/study before you can understand the concepts that it will never catch on because most will deem it as not worth it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I wrestle with the differences between TDD &amp; BDD. BDD always seems easier at the outset, but then later I have a harder time finding where things are. While reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137081073/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0137081073&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=chriortmspost-20">The Clean Coder</a> today I was on the chapter about testing strategies.
In this context it seems like component tests are better suited to BDD. Maybe identifying behavior can be subjective and that is why BDD naming is sometimes hard? Does it turn into another impedence mismatch? I think it must, if we reduce the impedence mismatch we would approach test case per class. So the the only difference is really assert vs should</p>

my twitter feed this morning. My first reaction was to make some snarky remarks about the javascript
community, but then I began to wonder to what degree to the values of a language attract people of similar values?</p>

<p>If the values of a language are to strive for the highest order of elegance and simplicity then people who
gravitate to those things will start using that language. I don&#8217;t want to stereotype people based on a programming
language choice as there are many other reasons someone might use a language, but either what I have observed or
my confirmation bias makes me think this is at least partly true.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been trying out <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> lately. The thing that really draws me to the editor is the nice package system,
the built in foldere drawer and the ability to edit multiple items at once.</p>

<p>My long time favorite editor is <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>
so I run with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html">Vintage</a> mode enabled. One thing that bothers me is that when in command
mode the cursor just looks like an underbar and for some reason I really miss that blinking square. Fortunately it looks like there
is <a href="https://github.com/netpro2k/SublimeBlockCursor">a plugin that will do just what I want</a></p>

<p>While I was looking for an option to enable the block cursor I stumbled upon another setting</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"font_options": ["directwrite"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;m not sure if i like this setting or not yet. The text seems crisper and larger, but it almost seems like the letters are too squished together.</p>

<p>Today I am setting up an <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a> blog. After <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/big-news">what happened with posterous</a> I really like the idea of owning my own content/data. I have tried several methods of journaling and blogging before, but struggle to stick with it. I think the git and simple text editor nature of octopress will work for me because it fits into my natural workflow.</p>

<p>I have been very enamored with the ideas of clojure and lisp lately. Mostly the ability to build your own language within them. I also love the purity of how everything is a list. I am working my way through Clojure Programming (currently at location 3483)</p>

<p>Am using <a href="http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/">MarkPad</a> to write this, but it keeps complaining about not being able to monitor locked files under .git, I suppose we can fix that&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to dig into the MarkPad source code, and realize I should post a screenshot of the error I&#8217;m getting so I quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?oq=octopress&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=octopress#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=octopress+images&amp;oq=octopress+images&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0l2j0i8j0i22.5591.6913.0.7065.7.5.0.2.2.0.180.769.0j5.5.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.WX0tFXap4GM&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=304ddafb65aaa7e0&amp;biw=903&amp;bih=913">check on how to do that with octopress</a>. It looks pretty easy.</p>

<p><img src="screen_shots/markpad_crash2.png"></p>

<p>I know it must be related to monitoring of a file or directory, so I do a git grep &#8220;FileSystemWatcher&#8221; which leads me to <a href="https://github.com/Code52/DownmarkerWPF/blob/master/src/MarkPad/Infrastructure/Abstractions/FileSystemWatcherWrapper.cs">FileSystemWatcherWrapper</a></p>

<p>Simple fix, <a href="">pull request</a> submitted.</p>
