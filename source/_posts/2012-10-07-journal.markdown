I have been trying out [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) lately. The thing that really draws me to the editor is the nice package system,
the built in foldere drawer and the ability to edit multiple items at once.

My long time favorite editor is [vim](http://www.vim.org)
so I run with [Vintage](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html) mode enabled. One thing that bothers me is that when in command
mode the cursor just looks like an underbar and for some reason I really miss that blinking square. Fortunately it looks like there
is [a plugin that will do just what I want](https://github.com/netpro2k/SublimeBlockCursor)

While I was looking for an option to enable the block cursor I stumbled upon another setting

{% codeblock %}
	"font_options": ["directwrite"]
{% endcodeblock %}

I'm not sure if i like this setting or not yet. The text seems crisper and larger, but it almost seems like the letters are too squished together.
