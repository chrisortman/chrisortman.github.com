Discovered `sp_MSforeach` via this morning's [Morning Dew](http://www.alvinashcraft.com/2012/11/23/dew-drop-november-23-2012-1448). `sp_MSforeach` is a stored proc that will let you execute a block of code for every table in a database.

Here is a example

```
exec sp_MSforeach 'print "?"'
```

Which will print:

 [dbo].[Customers]
 [dbo].[Orders]

etc
