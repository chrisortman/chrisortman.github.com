I don't think this is the right way to build software, especially developer tools & frameworks. It is probably politically correct and gives you a nice scape goat for lame features, but I think too much of the opinion here is based on mob-mentality and meme's than on merit.

The way to good frameworks is to build something real and then pull out the common parts, I think too often things get developed in behind closed doors in isolation and then put out to see how they function in the /real/ world.

Did you know about `Select-String -Context`? It let's you find lines in a file in powershell and then print out surrounding lines! Very useful [source](http://www.poshpete.com/powershell/parsing-log-files-with-select-string-and-context)
