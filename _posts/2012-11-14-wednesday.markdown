<p>
Auto loading of ConnectionStrings in ServerExplorer   â—¦if we detect that your ConnectionString points to a database which exists, then we load the connectionstring in the ServerExplorer so its there when you want to use it. This is an improvement from Dev10 where you had to explicitly add the ConnectionString

I had a hard time figuring out how to replicate the `var self = this;`  code that is often recommended in [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com). Up until finding [this article](http://notebookheavy.com/2012/10/03/typescript-and-knockout-computed/) I did not know about the `() => {}` lambda syntax in [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org)
