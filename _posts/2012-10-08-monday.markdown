This [post about OSS projects](https://plus.google.com/111465598045192916635/posts/CkmmbjmvebM) came across
my twitter feed this morning. My first reaction was to make some snarky remarks about the javascript
community, but then I began to wonder to what degree to the values of a language attract people of similar values?

If the values of a language are to strive for the highest order of elegance and simplicity then people who 
gravitate to those things will start using that language. I don't want to stereotype people based on a programming 
language choice as there are many other reasons someone might use a language, but either what I have observed or
my confirmation bias makes me think this is at least partly true.
