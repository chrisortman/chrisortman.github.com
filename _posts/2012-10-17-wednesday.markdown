Dug into SQL more than I normally would need to. Had to do some cleanup work and needed to be able to generate some reports of the data that got changed. [OUTPUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177564.aspx) and [INTO](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188029.aspx) have made it a lot easier than I remembered it being. This [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27894/whats-the-difference-between-a-temp-table-and-table-variable-in-sql-server) was also very helpful in choosing between temp tables or table variables.
