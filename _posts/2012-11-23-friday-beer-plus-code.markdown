I've been working on a little windows 8 store metro game for my 2 year old and wanted to be able to capture all keyboard input. I tried following the example from [here](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/Input-3dff271b) but was not able to make it work. I eventually found [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11812059/windows-8-metro-focus-on-grid) on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and got it to work. Frustrating though to have canned samples not work.
