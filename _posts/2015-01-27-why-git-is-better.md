Git is different /better/ than other version control systems because other systems give you commands for manipulating
files on your file system and communicating with a a system that tracks changes

Git on the otherhand gives you commands for manipulating a graph of your projects source code history and changes.
This is an important distinction and once you understand it your mind is in the right place to get the most 
out of git.
